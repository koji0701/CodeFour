Tech stack
- Backend: Python, OpenCV, YOLO face model, random YOLO license plate model from HuggingFace, uv
- Frontend: Basic "modern" stack (next, typescript, shadcn, etc), react-konva (interacting with bounding boxes on client side), pnpm

didn't mention in video but there's a quick api that directly interacts with the json created by the backend
